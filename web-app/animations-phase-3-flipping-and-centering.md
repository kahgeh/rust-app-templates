# Phase 3: Flip Animation with Center Movement

## Overview
Successfully implemented simultaneous card flip and center movement animation, creating a smooth transition from grid position to modal view and back.

## Implementation Details

### Opening Animation
When a card is clicked:
1. **Position Capture**: Card position is captured using `getBoundingClientRect()`
2. **Fixed Positioning**: Card breaks free from grid with `position: fixed` at captured coordinates
3. **Simultaneous Animation**: Card flips (180° Y-axis rotation) while moving to viewport center
4. **Transform Centering**: Uses `top: 50%, left: 50%` with `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)` for perfect centering

### Closing Animation
When close button is clicked:
1. **State Management**: Sets `$closing = true` to trigger reverse animation
2. **Reverse Movement**: Card animates from center back to original captured position
3. **Flip Reversal**: Card rotates back to 0° showing front face
4. **Cleanup**: After 600ms animation completes, all states are reset

### Key Technical Solutions

#### CSS Animation Approach
- Used `@keyframes` with only `to` state for opening (inherits from inline styles)
- Separate `slide-from-center` animation for closing
- Animation duration: 0.6s with smooth easing curve

#### State Management
```javascript
// Opening
$activeCardId = '{{ example.id }}';
$isFlipping = true;

// Closing
$closing = true;
setTimeout(() => {
  $activeCardId = '';
  $isFlipping = false;
  $closing = false;
}, 600);
```

#### Preventing Issues
- **Z-index Management**: Set to 9999 during animation to ensure card stays on top
- **Per-Card State**: Used `$activeCardId === '{{ example.id }}'` checks to prevent other cards being affected
- **Transform Reset**: Explicitly set `transform: none` for initial state to prevent jumping

### CSS Structure
```css
/* Opening animation */
.example-card.flipping {
    animation: slide-to-center 0.6s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1) forwards;
    z-index: 9999 !important;
}

/* Closing animation */
.example-card.closing {
    animation: slide-from-center 0.6s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1) forwards;
    z-index: 9999 !important;
}

/* Flip animations */
.example-card.flipping .card-flipper {
    transform: rotateY(180deg);
}

.example-card.closing .card-flipper {
    transform: rotateY(0deg);
}
```

### Datastar Bindings
- **Classes**: `data-class-flipping` and `data-class-closing` conditionally apply animation classes
- **Inline Styles**: Dynamic position, transform, and dimensions via `data-style-*` attributes
- **Global Signals**: Added `$closing` to base template for animation state tracking

## Result
✅ Smooth card flip animation from grid position to center
✅ Reverse animation follows same path back
✅ No jumping or jerky movements
✅ Other cards unaffected during animation
✅ High z-index ensures modal appears above all content

## Next Steps
- Add backdrop overlay that fades in/out
- Implement keyboard navigation (Escape key to close)
- Consider adding scale animation for more dramatic effect
